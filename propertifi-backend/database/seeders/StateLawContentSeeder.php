Under the California Tenant Protection Act of 2019 (AB 1482), landlords must have just cause to terminate a tenancy after a tenant has resided in the property for 12 months.\n\nJust cause reasons are divided into at-fault (non-payment of rent, lease violations, nuisance, criminal activity) and no-fault causes (owner move-in, substantial remodeling, removal from rental market). For at-fault evictions, landlords must provide 3-day notice to pay rent or quit for non-payment, or 3-day notice to perform covenant or quit for lease violations.\n\nFor no-fault evictions, landlords must provide 60-90 days notice depending on tenancy length and must pay relocation assistance equal to one month's rent. Month-to-month tenancies require 30 days notice for tenancies under one year, or 60 days for tenancies over one year.\n\nThe eviction lawsuit (unlawful detainer) can only be filed after the notice period expires and tenant fails to comply. Court proceedings typically take 3-6 weeks, and tenants have 5 days to respond to the complaint. Sheriff enforcement of eviction orders requires additional time after judgment.\n\nDuring the COVID-19 pandemic, California implemented additional protections including payment plans for rent debt and longer notice periods. Landlords must provide tenants with information about rental assistance programs and cannot evict solely for non-payment if tenant submits timely declaration of COVID-related financial distress.",

Landlords cannot refuse occupancy, advertise 'adults only,' or impose different rules. Senior housing (62+ communities or 55+ with at least 80% of units having one occupant 55+) qualify for exemptions.\n\nSexual orientation and gender identity protections prohibit discrimination based on LGBTQ+ status. Landlords cannot refuse to rent, impose different terms, or harass tenants based on sexual orientation or gender identity.\n\nReligious protections include reasonable accommodations for religious practices like installing mezuzah, observing dress codes, or scheduling showings around religious observances.\n\nPregnancy discrimination is prohibited under sex discrimination provisions. Landlords cannot refuse to rent to pregnant women, impose different terms, or harass based on pregnancy status.\n\nVictims of domestic violence, sexual assault, stalking, human trafficking, or elder/dependent adult abuse are protected class. Landlords cannot refuse to rent or terminate tenancy based on victim status.\n\nAdvertising cannot include discriminatory preferences or limitations. Even subtle preferences like 'perfect for young professionals' or 'great for empty nesters' can violate fair housing laws.\n\nCalifornia Department of Fair Employment and Housing investigates complaints and can impose damages, fines, injunctions, and policy changes. Private lawsuits are also available with attorney's fees for prevailing plaintiffs.",

Right to habitable premises is fundamental, requiring landlords to maintain structural integrity, working utilities, extermination of pests, functioning locks, and compliance with building codes.\n\nIf landlord fails to maintain habitability, tenant must provide written notice describing problem and allowing reasonable time for repair (typically 7 days). If landlord doesn't correct issue, tenant can: (1) withhold rent until repaired, depositing rent into court registry or escrow account; (2) repair and deduct from rent if cost doesn't exceed one month's rent; (3) terminate lease with 7 days notice; or (4) sue for damages.\n\nRight to peaceful enjoyment means landlords cannot unreasonably disturb tenants' use of property. Landlords must provide reasonable notice (typically 12 hours) before entering except for emergencies. Entry must be during reasonable hours (typically 7:30 AM - 8:00 PM).\n\nProtection from retaliation prohibits landlords from retaliating against tenants who exercise legal rights. Retaliation includes increasing rent, decreasing services, threatening eviction, or actually evicting in response to tenant's protected actions like requesting repairs or reporting code violations.\n\nTenant's protected actions include: complaining to landlord about habitability, reporting code violations to authorities, exercising rights under lease or law, and organizing or joining tenant organizations. If landlord retaliates within one year of tenant's protected action, presumption of retaliation exists.\n\nPrivacy rights limit landlord's ability to enter property. Emergency situations allow immediate entry. For repairs, inspections, or showings, landlord must provide advance notice. Tenant cannot unreasonably deny access for necessary repairs or showings to prospective tenants or buyers.\n\nCondominiums and homeowner associations are subject to additional regulations under Florida Statutes Chapters 718 and 720. Association rules cannot violate tenant's statutory rights, and rental restrictions must comply with state law.\n\nDomestic violence victims have special protections allowing early lease termination without penalty upon providing proper documentation. Victims cannot be evicted solely based on domestic violence incidents.\n\nUtility service is landlord's responsibility unless lease specifically assigns to tenant. Landlords cannot shut off utilities to force tenant out. Doing so constitutes illegal self-help eviction and subjects landlord to damages.\n\nTenants have right to organize and meet with other tenants to discuss living conditions without landlord interference or retaliation.",

Notice must be in writing and include specific information about amount and percentage of increase.\n\nLocal rent control ordinances in cities like Los Angeles, San Francisco, Oakland, Berkeley, and Santa Monica impose additional restrictions. These typically include annual rent increase limitations (often 3-4% or tied to 60% of CPI), registration requirements, petition processes for increases above allowable amounts, and just cause eviction protections.\n\nLos Angeles Rent Stabilization Ordinance (RSO) covers buildings built before October 1978, allowing annual increases up to 3-8% depending on CPI. Landlords must register units and pay annual fees. Banking of unused increases is permitted up to certain limits.\n\nSan Francisco Rent Ordinance covers buildings built before June 1979, with annual increase limits tied to 60% of CPI. Vacancy control was eliminated by Costa-Hawkins Act, allowing landlords to increase rent to market rate when unit becomes vacant.\n\nOakland's rent control covers buildings built before 1983, with complex formulas for allowable increases based on CPI. Oakland recently strengthened protections including eviction moratorium during local emergency and additional relocation assistance requirements.\n\nCosta-Hawkins Rental Housing Act (1995) limits local rent control by prohibiting vacancy control, exempting single-family homes and condos, and exempting new construction after specific dates. However, it allows local jurisdictions to otherwise regulate rents.\n\nBanking provisions allow landlords to carry forward unused portions of allowable increases in many jurisdictions. Capital improvement passthroughs allow landlords to petition for increases above annual limits to recover costs of major improvements.\n\nJust cause eviction protections accompany rent control, requiring landlords to prove specific reasons for termination. No-fault evictions often require relocation assistance payments to displaced tenants.",

Daytime temperatures (6 AM - 10 PM) must reach 68°F when outdoor temperature falls below 55°F. Nighttime indoor temperature must be at least 62°F regardless of outdoor temperature.

Housing court provides expedited HP proceedings for habitability claims.\n\nAnti-harassment protections prohibit landlords from using threats, intimidation, or other conduct to force tenants out. Prohibited harassment includes repeated frivolous lawsuits, unnecessary construction, refusing to accept rent, removing services, and verbal abuse. New York City's anti-harassment law (Administrative Code §27-2004) provides private right of action with treble damages.\n\nRight to privacy limits landlord entry. Reasonable notice (24-48 hours) is required for non-emergency entry, and entry must be during reasonable hours. Tenant can refuse entry for showings if proper notice not provided, though cannot unreasonably deny access for repairs.\n\nRent-stabilized and rent-controlled tenants have right to lease renewal on same terms. Landlords must offer renewal 90-150 days before lease expiration. Rent Stabilization Guidelines Board sets maximum allowable increases for one and two-year renewals.\n\nRetaliation is prohibited if tenant exercises legal rights. Protected actions include requesting repairs, reporting violations, organizing tenant associations, or testifying in proceedings. Retaliatory eviction or rent increase within six months of protected action creates presumption of retaliation.\n\nRight to organize allows tenants to form associations, meet with other tenants, and petition landlord for improvements without retaliation or interference. Landlords cannot prohibit tenant meetings in common areas or retaliate against organizers.\n\nDomestic violence survivors can terminate leases early without penalty by providing proper documentation. Landlords must change locks within 7 days of request by domestic violence victim.\n\nSenior citizens and disabled tenants may qualify for rent increases exemptions (SCRIE/DRIE) freezing rent at current level if income qualified.

Tenant cannot use this remedy more than once per rental period or three times per calendar year.\n\nEmergency situations (no heat in winter, no water, gas leak, major roof leak) require immediate attention.
